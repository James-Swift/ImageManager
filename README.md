Swift Web Development Framework - Image Resizer v0.0.3
==================


A PHP class and set of functions to make automatically re-sizing images for your website simple and secure.

This project's code has basically just been copied and pasted from the main [SWDF](https://github.com/swiftoid/SWDF) repo. Updates should be coming soon to define a standardised API and documentation, but for now the code is fairly usable.

To use this code, at your terminal type:

`git clone git://github.com/swiftoid/SWDF_image_resizer.git`

Then investigate the `example_config.php.txt` and `example_implementations.txt` files for ready-to-use code samples.

## Branching Model
