This file provides some example implementations of the SWDF_image_resizer tool.

The tool is split into two main parts:

	- A class which actually does the image manipulations: SWDF_image_resizer
	  Supports a variety of formats and can perform many different manipulations
	  of images aside from basic resizing.

	- A set of functions which allow you to secure which images on your system can 
	  and can't be resized (or in what ways they can be altered).

This later part is quite powerful, and is designed to be a drop in tool to completely
manage all the images on a web site. It can restrict access to certain folders or 
sizes, it supports caching of resized images to ease server load and even supports 
features like automatically water-marking certain sizes or images in certain folders.

The intended purpose of the SWDF_image_resizer tool is primarily this later function, 
but the resizing class itself is left exposed in case you wish to write your own 
security system or simply want an easy way to resize images on the fly.

Some usage examples are described below:

The following example shows the most common use of the SWDF_image_resizer tool:

#File: example.php

What's happening in that file? Basically it allows you to resize images on the fly. 

Imagine you have a photo album you want to put on your web site. Most cameras 
produce photos that are far too large to sensibly embed on a web-page. Before you
upload them, you could batch resize them all with a tool on your computer, but what 
if at a later date you wanted the photos a slightly different size?

With the example.php setup you could simply upload all your photos the server, 
specify a size for them in the config file, then embed them on your pages like so:

<img src="example.php?size=MY_SIZE&img=PATH_TO_IMG" />

You could perhaps specify a thumbnail size as well, and do:

<a href="link_to_album.html">
	My Holiday Album:<br/>
	<img src="example.php?size=thumbnail&img=images/album/holiday_pic_001.jpg" />
</a>

The point is, the script will resize the images for you on the fly. It also has the 
advantage that you change the size of any image on your site, or perhaps add a
watermark to some images, add an overlay etc. just by changing one setting in the 
config file, instead of finding your source files then manually adjusting them all 
and re-uploading everything.

Hopefully, this has given you an idea of how the SWDF_image_resizer_request() 
function can be used.
